				<div class="title">Digital image processing</div>
				<p>
					In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer
					algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a
					subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image
					processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows
					a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and
					can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion
					during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions
					(perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of
					multidimensional systems.

				<h2>History</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture
					processing as it often was called, were developed in the 1960s at the
					Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
					Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few other research
					facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo
					standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character
					recognition, and photograph enhancement. The cost of processing was
					fairly high, however, with the computing equipment of that era.
				</p>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/500" alt="Image" />
				<p>
					That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated
					as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available. Images
					then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such
					as television standards conversion. As general-purpose computers
					became faster, they started to take over the role of dedicated
					hardware for all but the most specialized and computer-intensive
					operations. With the fast computers and signal processors available in
					the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form of
					image processing and generally, is used because it is not only the
					most versatile method, but also the cheapest.
				</p>

				<p>
					Digital image processing technology for medical applications was
					inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in
					1994.
